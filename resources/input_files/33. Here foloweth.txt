         Here foloweth a lytell treatyse of the Beaute of Women

            newly translated out of Frenshe in to Englyshe.

         [Illustration: A woman playing a stringed instrument.
        The border of the illustration contains the Latin motto:
              PECCATI FORMA FEMINA EST ET HORTIS CONDICIO]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sōne of the mayde whome neuer none resembled
 In beaulte nor bounte syth the worlde began
 For both in hyr were perfaytely assembled
 Named is she Marye doughter to saynt Anne
 Guyde myne hande so that the gentylman
 That me desyred to reduce thys boke
 From frenshe to englyshe / be content / and than
 I take lytell cure what other there on loke.

 In frenshe (la beaute de femmes) is yt named
 The beaulte of women / in our Englyshe languag
 wherof to treate / I ought well to be blamed
 Consydered that I had neuer the vsage
 womens beaulte in body nor vysage
 For to regarde / and there vpon good reason
 Syth I am made (as an vnpleasant page)
 A cast a way from presence at eche season

 But what therof shall I leue of to wryte
 Syth no man hauyng more practyse then I
 wyll take the payne to set blacke on the whyte
 And yt a thynge so dygne of memory
 Nay trust me playne I shall my selffe applye
 Of the frenshe boke to folow the sentence
 Beaulte (as ryght requireth) to gloryfye
 what euer foloweth of the consequence

 what caused the wourthy Troylus of Troye
 To cast hys loue on Cresyde the shene
 why set Parys on fayre Helayne hys ioye
 what caused Achylles to loue Polexene
 why loued Trystram la belle Isoude the quene
 Or Arthur of bretayne the fayre Florence
 All cam of theyr beaulte and theyr plesant eyen
 what haue I to do as of the consequence.

 Beaulte as for the fyrste require wolde
 That the womam (how euer stande the case)
 Symple manyer and countenaunce sholde holde
 For otherwyse she wyll avoyde the place

 womans beaulte eche person reproueth
 yf so be that she bayre the countenaunce
 More eleuate or hygh than yt behoueth
 Hyr beaulte tourneth but all to dysplesance

 Beaulte requireth as for the seconde parte
 That woman bayre euer naturally
 Symple regade and not ouerthwarte
 wyth playsante and symple castyng of the eye

 Beaulte is lost in woman oultrely
 yf she haue thys of very condycyon
 As to regarde or loke dyspyteously
 For that is the manner of the lyon

 womans beaulte requireth thyrdely
 That stedfastly with out oultrage
 She kepe as dyscrete cōtynually
 Symple answer euer in her language

 womans beaulte that sholde be magnyfyed
 Lyetly compassed in these thre poyntes onely
 what beaulte so euer is to her applyed
 The woman ought to lede hyr lyffe symply

 Beaulte of suerty doeth that woman folowe
 That hath the browes and raynes of the backe
 And there withall the fete lyght and holowe
 yf these thre be holowe there is no lacke.

 Beaulte in woman is nothyng pleasant
 That glometh with her eyen with frowarde chere
 And is of hyr raynes so heuy and pesant
 And of hyr fete as yf a beest yt were

 womans beaulte shall ye fynde doubtlesse
 In thre hygh poyntes that on hyr body gent
 Ought for to be / & them I shall expresse
 Here after / yf my remembraunce assent

 Beaulte sayeth / the fyrst poynt to knowe
 The woman sholde haue the forhed hygh & fayre
 For whan she hath the forhed ouer lowe
 Euyll hyr besemeth a frontelet to bayre

 womans beaulte requyreth secondly
 Of beaulte a ryght who that enquire wolde
 That woman ought to haue the hed hygh
 The better therwyth hyr hat she doeth vpholde

 Beaulte in woman playnly doeth habounde
 yf she ne fayle as for the thyrde parte
 To haue the brestes hygh fayre and rounde
 wyth fyne gorgias well and fayre couert

 womans beaulte as in preemynence
 Requireth these thre poyntes pryncypall
 For to be founde vpon hyr corpulence
 And well on hyght they ought for to be all

 womans beaulte expresly for to showe
 As to the regarde of hyr countenaunce
 Requireth ouer thys to haue thre poyntes lowe
 whych all women ought to haue in remembraunce

 womans beaulte that pourchase wyll praysyng
 woll that the woman set her besy cure
 To maynteyne in hyr selfe a low laughyng
 To laugh ouer hygh besemeth no creature

 Beaulte yet cōmaundeth afterwarde
 Vnto all women thys poynt secondely
 To haue alwayes a lowely regarde
 Not ouer moche but moderately

 That woman hath the bent of beaultyes bowe
 That can regarde in helth and in dysease
 whan she shall neese to make the sounde but lowe
 To do otherwyse yt may no person please

 womans beaulte wyll in conclusyon
 Of these lowe poyntes without desloyaulte
 That women bere euer a lowly condycyon
 For otherwyse she leseth her beaulte.

 Beaulte demaundeth these poyntes to haue sene
 In women that be fayre and fayte at all
 To haue trayteys the browes / and traytys eyen
 And lytell the handes / traytys slendre and small

 Beaulte hath she that hath the chyn dympled
 The ioyntes of the handes sholde be in lyke manere
 The chekes also be they bare or wympled
 Especyally whan she smyleth with hyr chere.

 Beaulte requireth large to haue these thre
 The fyrste is the space goyng from eye to eye
 Betwyxt the sholdres sholde the seconde be
 The thyrde betwyxt the raynes ye shall espye.

 Perfayt beaulte ye may well determyne
 In woman / so that these thre in hyr repayre
 The nayles and the lyppes cōplexyon sanguyne
 And ruddy the chekes well vermayled and fayre

 womans beaulte thou doest well expose
 Or mayst expose wythout taryeng
 yf thou retayne in thy mynde close
 All that is set before in this wrytyng.

 Of beaulte yf there be any woman
 More purely sped than is cōprysed in this
 was neuer woman syth the worlde began
 So perfaytly sped of beaulte as she is

 I haue expressed theyr preemynence
 As well of theyr bodyes as of theyr mayntyen
 But speke what ye wyll apert or in scylence
 Beaulte sans bonte ne vault rien.

 Beaultyes there be in women infynyte
 But of bontyes there is but lytell speche
 Beaulte is them geuen as thyng requisyte
 who wyll haue bonte let hym go seche
 Thys not wythstandyng I coulde a man teche
 To fynde ryght good of the gendre feminyn
 And fayre also / but what euer we preche
 Beaulte sans bonte ne vault rien.

 Beaulte ennobleth the person doubtlesse
 And playnly she is of the more valeure
 But wyth beaulte is requisyte goodnesse
 To speke a ryght who so wyll sett hys cure
 Bonte wyll not be vnder coverture
 where euer she be / hyr purete is so fyne
 wherfore I set agayne in thys scrypture
 Beaulte sans bonte ne vault rien.

 Mayde / wyfe / or wydowe / dame / or damoysell
 That haue the raye of beaulte comprysed in your face
 Adiouste therto bonte / than shall ye do ryght well
 For beaulte with bonte assembled in a place
 Gyue demonstrance of an especyall grace
 Geuen to the person / & as I take the cause
 At syse smyleth bonte / where beaulte laugheth at ace
 As dayly yt is sene / and there a fynall clause.


                                F I N I S


 Thus endeth the Beaulte of women neuly Imprynted
 By Rycharde Fawkes dwellyng in duram rent

                          Transcriber’s Notes


New original cover art included with this ebook is granted to the public
domain.

Pilcrows, which separated the stanzas of the poem in the printed text,
have been omitted in this edition. Stanzas are instead separated by a
blank line.

The original printed edition did not use uppercase “w” or “y”, even at
the beginning of a line of verse. This has been retained in this
edition. All spellings, even those likely to be errors in printing (such
as “womam” for “woman” in the fifth stanza), have been left as in the
printed original. In the Latin motto on the title page, reproduced in
HTML and other illustrated versions, “HORTIS” is likely an error; it
should be “MORTIS.”

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
